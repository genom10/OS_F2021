Shortest-first algorithm has shown the best performance for processes evenly distributed by arrival and burst time. Howver when tested on dataset with one process taking much more time than others FCFS delayed other process significanly, while SJN didn't start working on longest process until the very end. Round-robin on the other hand finished the long process and carried on with execution of smaller ones.
It should be noticed that when average burst time of a process approcahes or what worse exceeds quanum of round-robin algorithm its performance gets much worse because almost finished processes are stopped and placed at the end of the execution queue which significanly delays its completion.
